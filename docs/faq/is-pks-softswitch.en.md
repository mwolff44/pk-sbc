# Is P-KISS-SBC a VoIP softswitch ?

A [softswitch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softswitch) is a software component of a telecoms network used to connect calls between subscribers or other telecoms equipment.

There are 2 categories of softswitch: class 4 systems and class 5 systems. This classification is an analogy with [switched telephone networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_switched_telephone_network).

A class 4 softswitch is used to transport VoIP flows between operators; it is an interconnection solution.
A class 5 softswitch, on the other hand, is designed to provide a telephony service to end subscribers, like an [IPBX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_PBX) for example.

And to answer the question, yes, P-KISS-SBC is a class 4 softswitch.
