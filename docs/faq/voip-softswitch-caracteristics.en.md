# What are the characteristics of a class 4 softswitch ?

Softswitches used for the transit of VoIP traffic between operators are generally called class 4 softswitches.

The main function of a class 4 softswitch is to route large volumes of VoIP calls. 

The most important features are scalability in terms of the number of simultaneous calls and new calls (CPS), protocol translation and transcoding.
